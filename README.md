# Unity Microphone Recognition
This repo is a project to test interactions with a microphone and Unity. The intention of this test is to test some techniques related to the recognition of microphones to be able to apply them in the final project of the subject "Narrative in real time" of the university career "Design and development of video games" taught at the CITM in Spain.

# Description
In this project exist 2 scenes. 

In the scene "Mic Intensities" there is a simple test to clasify the intensity of the Mic input in 3 categories: Whispers, Loud, and Scream. To clasify between thsi three categories, it is used some intervals in DBs(Decibels). In this particulary case, the values are setted from my microhpone and it might be different with others mics, but it can be changed in the code.

In the anoher scene "Voice recognition", consist in move and rotate the object in the scene with some keywords defined in the code. In this case, the words are in spanish and there are only 8 actions but with this framework it can be expanded with more actions easly.

## Keywords
The keywords in spanish used in this scene are the following:

*Adelante*: Move forward.
*Atras*: Move backward.
*Sube*: Move up.
*Baja*: Move down.
*Derecha*: Rotate to the right.
*izquierda*: Rotate to the left.
*Arriba*: Rotate up.
*Abajo*: Rotate down.
